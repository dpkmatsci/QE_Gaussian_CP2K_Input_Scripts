## Documentation



The input scripts for cell relaxation, slab relaxation and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) in the open source package CP2K have been provided in the above folders.
Useful links for CP2K: [https://www.cp2k.org/], [https://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/], [https://www.cp2k.org/exercises]

Input and output files are in *.inp and *.out format.
